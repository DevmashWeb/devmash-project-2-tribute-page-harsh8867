<h1>About Virat Kohli</h1>

<article>
Virat Kohli (born 5 November 1988) is a formidable top order batsman for India and RCB. Virat Kohli plays his game aggressively, bares his emotions loudly in public, and yet retains the element of maturity that forms an integral part of every good and great player. Kohli was the captain of the victorious Indian team at the 2008 U19 WC held in Malaysia.<br>

<br>Today he is recognized for his passion, exuberance, leadership skills and, of course his superb skills with the bat in hand. Even in the presence, or absence, of his other prolific partners, Kohli has become one of the most dependable batsmen in the Indian top order.<br>

<br>He was an important member during India's World Cup triumph in 2011, where he struck vital centuries in the tournament. His achievements on and off the field are not going unnoticed as he received the ICC ODI Player of the year award in 2012 and 2014 and was rated by SportsPro as the 13th most marketable athlete in the world.<br>

<br>His gung-ho attitude, his youthful charm and his aggression have also made him the captain of his IPL team, the Royal Challengers Bangalore in the 2013 IPL season. Virat Kohli also won Man of the Tournament award in ICC World T20, 2014.<br>

<br>His fantastic fielding and ability to assess situations and seize the moment, make Kohli one of the most exciting young talents to watch out for in the international circuit. Kohli has a swagger, whether cruising to the crease or strutting through an airport in his shades.<br>

<br>Time and again, the 25-year-old Delhi lad has displayed his batting prowess across formats and situations. He has been credited with mastering the art of run chases and praised for his knack of walking in to bat in any situation and taking it by scruff of its neck. There is certainly nothing abrasive about his bat,
 which seems to have a never-ending sweet spot. His timing on the leg side is sublime, while his cover drive could soothe the most troubled brow.<br>

 <br>In the joyous aftermath of India's World Cup victory last year, the team carried Sachin Tendulkar around the ground on their shoulders; when asked about it a few minutes later, Kohli said "Tendulkar has carried the burden of the nation for 21 years so it's time we carried him on our shoulders".<br> </article></div>
